# Quickstart
Setting up AniLife requires no more than 10 seconds (excluding library preparation). Things you'll need:
 - AniDB Client Credentials
   - Login to your AniDB profile
   - Navigate to [Softwares](https://anidb.net/software/add)
   - Create a new client
   - Fill the required information
   - Get your **Client Name** and **Client Version**
 
1. Start AniLife
2. Fill the Client Name and Version of your client
3. Select your Library locations (leave empty if you don't have one)
4. Select AniLife Data location, this will be used for local caching and library data (leave unset to use Windows's Appdata folder)
5. If AniDB Search cache download fails a message will appear:
 - Click download file manually
 - Locate the downloaded file and AniLife will automatically load it
6. Wait for Library scanning
7. You're Done !
